# Gif-finder

Utilized Bootstrap, css, html and javascript

The site has a group of buttons pre-loaded.
    When the buttons are clicked a group of gifs in reference to that button appear with their rating above them.   
    Pressing on the gif causes it to animate, pressing again will cancel the animation and bring it back to original still frame

On the right side of the screen is an input form
    You can request anything within that for, but lets stick with tv series
    When you type out the tv series and hit submit it will create a button with the tv series name in it and append it to the end of the list of buttons pre-loaded.
    When that button is pressed a group of gifs in reference to that series will appear.
